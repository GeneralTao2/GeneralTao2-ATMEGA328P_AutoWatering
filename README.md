#### About
Here I wrote a program for AVR microcontroller. The program works with a lot of sensors and actuators. The system this program serves is a garden or field auto wattering. The 
whole system is layout of real system. Was simulated only in Proteus program.

#### Project
This project was just for practice of programming AVR microcontroller.
